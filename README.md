# Coursera_Capstone

This is the final capstone project of the Coursera course " IBM Professional Data Science Certificate". The project will attempt to analyse neighborhoods within the Greater Toronto Area (GTA) to find out what makes them similar or different in terms of the services they offer to residents, popularity, causes of complaints, etc. The objective is to help guide residents planning to move from one neighborhood to another for job or other personal reasons.
